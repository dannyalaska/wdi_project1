#[Play My Game Here](http://retailer-dog-53053.bitballoon.com/)

#### Description:

* I started this project with the idea of making something like duckhunt. A sort of shooting-gallery game in which you had to take out specific targets in a certain amount of time.
* I managed to do just that and then a whole lot more.  This game has multiple targets moving on randomized paths.  It has the ability to keep track of your score and level up when you hit a certain amount of targets.
If you don't hit the targets within a certain amount of time the game will end.  
* One thing that I would change is that the explosions on the ships does not have any sound included.  I tried to get a sound to play along with the click but it didn't work.
* I also would have liked more time to compose a better song to play at the introduction and throughout the game.  I didn't want to waste time so I only made a very short loop to play when the game loads.  
* Overall I am very pleased with my game. If someone told me a month ago that I would be able to create something like this from scratch I might not have believed them. 

#### User Stories: 
* I forget what browser games were like in the 90's, make me one of those!
* I need a shooter that includes cool graphics and explosions. I want to know how many I've shot and what level I am at. 
* I need some sweet sounds to keep the game actively grabbing my interest.
